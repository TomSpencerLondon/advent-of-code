### Problem Summary: Advent of Code - Day 1: Historian Hysteria

### Simple Summary:

The Chief Historian is missing, and the Elves are trying to find him by checking locations he might have visited. Each location has a unique number (a location ID), and the Elves found two lists of these numbers in his office.

The problem is the two lists are different, and you need to help them reconcile the lists by:
1. Sorting both lists.
2. Pairing numbers from the two lists (smallest with smallest, next smallest with next smallest, etc.).
3. Calculating the difference between each pair of numbers.
4. Adding up all these differences to get the total distance.

#### Goal:
Given your puzzle input (actual lists of location IDs), calculate and return the **total distance**.
